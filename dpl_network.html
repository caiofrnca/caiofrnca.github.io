    <h1>Network Infrastructure and Cybersecurity Project</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project was developed to design and implement a modern network infrastructure and virtualization solution for Dublin Pharmaceutical Limited (DPL). As the company expanded to a new greenfield site, the focus was on ensuring secure communication, high availability, and optimized operations using advanced networking and virtualization technologies.</p>
    <p>As this project is complex, I have not posted all the technical details here. If you are interested, please get in touch.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The primary objective was to design and deploy an infrastructure capable of supporting high availability, fault tolerance, and secure inter-office and internet communication. This included network design, IP management, VoIP solutions, and implementation of security best practices such as firewall rules and VLAN segregation.</p>

    <h2>Key Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Networking Models:</strong> TCP/IP and OSI layers, applied to ensure compatibility and communication across devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Routing Protocols:</strong> OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) for WAN communication between the main office and partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP):</strong> Used to provide redundancy and failover capability for critical paths in the network.</li>
        <li><strong>VLANs:</strong> Virtual LANs were implemented to segregate network traffic for different departments and enhance security.</li>
        <li><strong>VoIP:</strong> Voice over IP was implemented for efficient and cost-effective communication using Cisco devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtualization:</strong> VirtualBox was used to virtualize CentOS servers, providing services such as DHCP, DNS, and SFTP.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</strong> Cloud-based VM instances were set up to enhance disaster recovery and business continuity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network Infrastructure Design</h2>
    <p>The network followed a hierarchical design model based on Cisco's best practices. The key components include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Core switches providing high availability and routing for internal and external communications.</li>
        <li>Access switches configured with VLANs for departmental segmentation (Manufacturing, R&D, Sales/Marketing).</li>
        <li>Firewall rules for external communication filtering and internal network security.</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

    <h3>VLAN Configuration</h3>
    <p>To segment the network, VLANs were created for each department, ensuring secure communication within their broadcast domains. Trunk ports were used to allow multiple VLANs to pass through a single link.</p>
    <pre>
    vlan 10
    name Manufacturing
    vlan 20
    name R&D
    vlan 30
    name Sales
    </pre>

  <img src="./img/dpl_network/9.jpg" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>

    <h2>VoIP Implementation</h2>
    <p>The VoIP system was deployed using a Cisco 2811 router, configured to handle IP telephony services. A dedicated voice VLAN (VLAN 50) was used for efficient communication between IP phones.</p>

  <img src="./img/dpl_network/16.jpg" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>

    <h2>Virtualization</h2>
    <p>Virtualized services such as DHCP, DNS, and web services were deployed on CentOS virtual machines, both locally via VirtualBox and remotely via Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</p>
    <p>Key services included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DHCP:</strong> Automates IP allocation for internal devices.</li>
        <li><strong>SFTP:</strong> Secure File Transfer Protocol service set up for secure file transfers.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS:</strong> Domain Name Service providing name resolution for internal networks.</li>
    </ul>

                      <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/dpl_network/5.jpg" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>

    <h2>Security Best Practices</h2>
    <p>Security was a major focus of this project. Key practices implemented include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RADIUS for centralized authentication and access control.</li>
        <li>Password encryption on Cisco devices using <code>service password-encryption</code>.</li>
        <li>Firewall rules to restrict traffic based on whitelist policies.</li>
        <li>Regular security patch updates for both network devices and virtual machines.</li>
    </ul>

                          <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/dpl_network/4.jpg" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>

    <h2>Testing and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Network and system tests were conducted in phases to ensure all components functioned as expected. This included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ping and traceroute tests to validate network connectivity.</li>
        <li>VoIP call tests to confirm successful IP telephony deployment.</li>
        <li>DHCP and DNS tests to verify IP address allocation and name resolution.</li>
    </ul>

                              <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/dpl_network/17.jpg" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project successfully delivered a robust, secure, and scalable network infrastructure for DPL. The combination of advanced routing protocols, VLAN segmentation, VoIP services, and virtualization created a future-proof solution capable of supporting the company's growth.</p>
