    <h1>Guided Technology Project: DPL Network Infrastructure</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This project focuses on the design and implementation of a new network infrastructure for Dublin Pharmaceutical Limited (DPL), aimed at adapting the company's technology to meet its growth and expansion needs. The project ensures security, productivity, and cutting-edge communication solutions using modern technology.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>DPL, a pharmaceutical company, required an overhaul of its IT infrastructure due to recent expansions. The project covered networking, cloud computing, and security to ensure seamless communication between branches and business partners, enhancing productivity and operational efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The project aimed to build a resilient, high-performance network infrastructure capable of supporting DPL's future growth. It included high-availability network topology, virtualization, and security best practices, ensuring secure communication and business continuity.</p>

    <h2>Key Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cisco Hierarchical Network Design</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Virtual LANs (VLANs)</strong> for network segmentation</li>
        <li><strong>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</strong> and <strong>Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)</strong> for routing and fault tolerance</li>
        <li><strong>CentOS</strong> for hosting key services such as DHCP, DNS, and web services</li>
        <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong> for cloud-based backup and scalability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Network Topology</strong>: Design of a high-availability topology, utilizing VLANs to segment DPL's departments (Manufacturing, R&D, Sales).</li>
        <li><strong>VoIP Implementation</strong>: Setup of VoIP communication using Cisco 2811 routers for a modern, cost-efficient communication system.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Best Practices</strong>: Use of RADIUS for centralized authentication and encryption mechanisms to secure device management.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Integration</strong>: Setup of virtual machines on Google Cloud to ensure redundancy and scalability, supporting business continuity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The project was rigorously tested for connectivity, security, and performance using a layered approach based on the OSI model. Virtualization services and cloud-based backups were also thoroughly tested to ensure redundancy.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The DPL network infrastructure project successfully established a secure, scalable, and cost-efficient network, ensuring long-term sustainability and business growth.</p>
