        <h1>LetsDefend SIEM Lab: Phishing Alert – Deceptive Mail Detected</h1>
        <p class="section-intro">
          In this lab I worked as a SOC analyst in the LetsDefend platform, investigating a phishing
          alert generated by a SIEM rule (<strong>SOC282 – Phishing Alert: Deceptive Mail Detected</strong>).
          The goal was to analyse the email, identify malicious artifacts, confirm impact on the user,
          and recommend appropriate containment and remediation actions.
        </p>

        <!-- OVERVIEW -->
        <article class="card">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            A phishing email with the subject “Free Coffee Voucher” was delivered to a user (Felix) from
            <code>free@coffeeshoop.com</code>. The SIEM raised an alert, but the email security product
            showed the action as <strong>allowed</strong>, meaning the message reached the user’s inbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acting as the analyst on duty, I took ownership of the ticket, followed the phishing playbook,
            analysed the email content, URLs, and attachment, and confirmed that the campaign was malicious
            and associated with <strong>AsyncRAT</strong> command-and-control activity.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Blue team / SOC investigation</li>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> SIEM alert triage, phishing analysis, malware artefact review</li>
            <li><strong>Platform:</strong> LetsDefend SOC simulation (SIEM &amp; case management)</li>
            <li><strong>Status:</strong> Completed – alert classified as <strong>True Positive</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <!-- OBJECTIVES -->
        <article class="card">
          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Investigate a SIEM-generated phishing alert in a simulated SOC environment.</li>
            <li>Apply a structured phishing playbook to ensure consistent incident handling.</li>
            <li>Analyse the email, URLs, and attachment to identify malicious behaviour and IOCs.</li>

            <li>Document findings, IOCs, and recommended remediation and awareness actions.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <!-- ENVIRONMENT & TOOLS -->
        <article class="card">
          <h2>Environment &amp; Tools</h2>
          <p>
            The investigation was conducted entirely within the LetsDefend blue-team training platform,
            which simulates a SOC with alert queues, cases, and log visibility.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> LetsDefend SOC – Monitoring &amp; Investigation channels</li>
            <li><strong>Data sources:</strong> Email security alerts, endpoint logs, network logs</li>
            <li><strong>Security tools:</strong> SIEM console, phishing playbook, log management views</li>
            <li><strong>External analysis:</strong> VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, AnyRun, URLHaus, URLScan</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <!-- METHODOLOGY -->
        <article class="card">
          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Ticket triage:</strong> Reviewed the SOC ticket queue, filtered by severity, and took ownership of the phishing alert.</li>
            <li><strong>Case creation:</strong> Created and linked a case to track all investigative steps, findings, and decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Playbook-driven workflow:</strong> Followed the phishing playbook to ensure each phase (email parsing, URL/attachment analysis, impact assessment) was covered.</li>
            <li><strong>Email analysis:</strong> Parsed headers, sender, recipient, timestamps, and observed the suspicious attachment and “Free Coffee” lure.</li>
            <li><strong>URL &amp; attachment analysis:</strong> Extracted URLs and the ZIP attachment link, analysed them using sandbox and threat intelligence tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Endpoint and network review:</strong> Correlated endpoint activity, browser history, and network logs for the victim host (Felix’s workstation at <code>172.16.20.151</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Scope &amp; C2 check:</strong> Verified whether other users received the same email and looked for evidence of C2 communications in the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting &amp; closure:</strong> Documented IOCs, artefacts, and remediation recommendations, then closed the alert as a True Positive.</li>
          </ol>
        </article>

        <!-- KEY FINDINGS -->
        <article class="card">
          <h2>Key Findings</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The phishing email successfully bypassed automated blocking and was delivered to Felix,
              increasing the risk of user interaction with the malicious content.
            </li>
            <li>
              URL and file analysis confirmed the attachment as <strong>malicious</strong>, associated
              with <strong>AsyncRAT</strong>, a remote access trojan used for full remote control of infected hosts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Threat intelligence revealed multiple concerning capabilities, such as process manipulation, VM detection,
              and outbound connections to a known malicious host (<code>37.120.233.226</code> on TCP/3451).
            </li>
            <li>
              Log review showed no evidence of the email being delivered to other users, and no lateral spread beyond Felix’s host.
            </li>
            <li>
              The investigation highlighted the importance of user awareness, better email filtering, and improved detection rules for phishing campaigns.
