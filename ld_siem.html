    <h1>LetsDefend | SOC | Phishing Alert - SIEM Walkthrough</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In my journey to becoming a skilled SOC analyst, I aim to immerse myself in practical labs and real-world scenarios 
        to prepare for the challenges of defending against cyber threats. The LetsDefend platform provides an incredible 
        opportunity to simulate working in a Security Operations Center (SOC), enabling hands-on experience with investigating 
        and responding to various security incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
        This walkthrough showcases how I tackled a phishing alert using LetsDefend’s SOC environment, honing my cybersecurity 
        skills in the process.

    <h2>What is LetsDefend?</h2>
    <p>
        LetsDefend is a hands-on Blue Team training platform that simulates a SOC environment. It allows users to gain practical 
        experience by investigating real-world cyber attack scenarios, working on alerts, and applying industry-standard processes 
        to identify, contain, and remediate threats.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a SOC?</h2>
    <p>
        A Security Operations Center (SOC) is the command center for an organization’s cybersecurity defenses. SOC analysts monitor 
        and analyze network activity, detect threats, and take action to protect the organization from cyber incidents. A SOC combines 
        skilled personnel, advanced technologies, and robust processes to safeguard an organization’s assets and data.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
    <p>
        Phishing is a cyber attack where threat actors use fraudulent communications—often via email—to deceive recipients into revealing 
        sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data. This type of attack remains one of the most common and effective 
        methods used by cybercriminals.

    <h2>Activity Overview</h2>
    <h3>Event ID 257: SOC282 — Phishing Alert — Deceptive Mail Detected</h3>
    <p>
        In this scenario, a suspicious email with the subject line “Free Coffee Voucher” was sent to a user named Felix on May 13, 2024, 
        at 9:22 AM. The sender’s email address was <code>free@coffeeshoop.com</code>, and this triggered the SOC282 rule: Phishing Alert - 
        Deceptive Mail Detected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite being flagged as suspicious, the email security product marked the action as “allowed,” meaning no preventative measures 
        were taken to block or quarantine the email.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of this investigation was to analyze the alert, identify any malicious intent, and determine the necessary actions to 
        protect the network from potential harm.
