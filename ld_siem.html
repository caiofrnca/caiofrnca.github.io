    <h1>LetsDefend | SOC | SIEM Walkthrough -      Phishing Alert - Deceptive Mail Detected</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In my journey to becoming a skilled SOC analyst, I aim to immerse myself in practical labs and real-world scenarios 
        to prepare for the challenges of defending against cyber threats. The LetsDefend platform provides an incredible 
        opportunity to simulate working in a Security Operations Center (SOC), enabling hands-on experience with investigating 
        and responding to various security incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
        This walkthrough showcases how I tackled a phishing alert using LetsDefend’s SOC environment, honing my cybersecurity 
        skills in the process.

    <h2>What is LetsDefend?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://letsdefend.io">LetsDefend</a> is a hands-on Blue Team training platform that simulates a SOC environment. It allows users to gain practical 
        experience by investigating real-world cyber attack scenarios, working on alerts, and applying industry-standard processes 
        to identify, contain, and remediate threats.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a SOC?</h2>
    <p>
        A Security Operations Center (SOC) is the command center for an organization’s cybersecurity defenses. SOC analysts monitor 
        and analyze network activity, detect threats, and take action to protect the organization from cyber incidents. A SOC combines 
        skilled personnel, advanced technologies, and robust processes to safeguard an organization’s assets and data.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
    <p>
        Phishing is a cyber attack where threat actors use fraudulent communications—often via email—to deceive recipients into revealing 
        sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data. This type of attack remains one of the most common and effective 
        methods used by cybercriminals.
    </p>

    <h2>Activity Overview</h2>
    <h3>Event ID 257: SOC282 — Phishing Alert — Deceptive Mail Detected</h3>
    <p>
        In this scenario, a suspicious email with the subject line “Free Coffee Voucher” was sent to a user named Felix on May 13, 2024, 
        at 9:22 AM. The sender’s email address was <code>free@coffeeshoop.com</code>, and this triggered the SOC282 rule: Phishing Alert - 
        Deceptive Mail Detected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite being flagged as suspicious, the email security product marked the action as “allowed,” meaning no preventative measures 
        were taken to block or quarantine the email.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of this investigation was to analyze the alert, identify any malicious intent, and determine the necessary actions to 
        protect the network from potential harm.

<h2>Task 1 - Check the SOC Ticket Queue</h2>
<p>
    The SOC ticket queue is essential for managing incidents effectively. It allows analysts to track, prioritize, and triage alerts while maintaining accountability 
    and providing insights for trend analysis.
</p>
<p>
    In LetsDefend’s SOC simulation, I accessed the ticket queue under the “Practice” tab and navigated to the “Monitoring” section to locate the phishing alert.
</p>

<h2>Task 2 - Take Ownership and Create a Case</h2>
<p>
    After identifying the phishing alert, I took ownership of the ticket by pressing the action button on the Main channel. The ticket now is seen on the Investigation Channel. There, I created a case to document my investigation and actions. Proper case management ensures the incident is tracked and resolved systematically.
</p>

<h2>Task 3 - Utilize the Playbook</h2>
<p>
    Alerts can vary widely, from phishing to malware, web attacks, and ransomware. Each alert type requires a different approach for investigation and response. Playbooks 
    provide structured workflows to ensure consistent and effective handling of alerts generated by SIEM or other security tools.
</p>

<h2>Task 5 - Email Analysis</h2>
<p>
    The first step of the playbook, 'Parse Email,' instructs us to gather key details about the received email, including information such as sender, recipient, time, and any 
    suspicious content or attachments.
</p>

<h2>Task 6 - Analyze URLs and Attachments</h2>
<p>
    When assessing emails, it is essential to examine any included URLs and attachments. Utilizing third-party sandbox environments enables safe analysis of these elements, 
    ensuring we can detect potential threats without compromising system integrity.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Malware Detection:</b> Analyze attachments to identify malicious content.</li>
    <li><b>Phishing Detection:</b> Review URLs to uncover deceptive schemes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task 7 - Containment and Remediation</h2>
<p>
    Upon confirming the phishing attempt, I alerted relevant stakeholders and blocked the identified URLs and sender domain. Additionally, I conducted a network and log analysis on 
    the affected endpoint to ensure no further threats were present.
</p>

<h2>Task 8 - Report Artifacts and IOCs</h2>
<p>
    I documented all indicators of compromise (IOCs) and artifacts associated with the phishing email in the case file for future reference and threat intelligence sharing.
</p>

<h2>Task 9 - Close the Ticket</h2>
<p>
    After completing the investigation, I classified the alert as a true positive and officially closed the ticket in the SOC monitoring page.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    This exercise on LetsDefend provided me with hands-on experience in analyzing and responding to phishing alerts within a simulated SOC environment. 
    By leveraging the tools, processes, and techniques available, I gained practical skills in incident management, email analysis, threat containment, and reporting—all essential 
    capabilities for a SOC analyst.
