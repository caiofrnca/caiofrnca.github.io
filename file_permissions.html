    <h1>File Permissions in Linux</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>In this lab, I demonstrate the use of Linux commands to configure authorization. 
    Authorization is crucial for granting access to specific system resources, ensuring that 
    unauthorized users cannot access or modify sensitive files, which is vital to system security. 
    In Linux, file and directory permissions are used to define who can access particular files 
    and directories.</p>
    <p>As a security analyst, setting appropriate access permissions is essential to protecting 
    sensitive information and maintaining the overall security of a system.</p>

    <h2>Steps to Check File and Directory Details</h2>
    <p>In this scenario, I examine and manage file permissions in the <code>/home/researcher2/projects</code> directory 
    for the user <strong>researcher2</strong>, who is part of the <strong>research_team</strong> group. 
    Using the command <code>ls -la</code>, I checked the permissions for all files in the directory, 
    including hidden files, to ensure they align with proper authorization.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First, I confirmed the current directory using <code>pwd</code>, then listed all directories using the <code>ls</code> command.</li>
        <li>Next, I accessed the <strong>projects</strong> directory (<code>cd projects</code>) and checked the permissions for all 
        files, including hidden files, using <code>ls -la</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A dot (<code>.</code>) preceding a file or directory name indicates a hidden item. For example, in this folder, 
    the file <strong>.project_x.txt</strong> is hidden.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Permissions String</h2>
    <p>Each file or directory entry begins with a 10-character string indicating its permissions. 
    For example, the string <code>drwxrwxrwx</code> represents a directory where the owner, group, 
    and others have full permissions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>1st character</strong> indicates the file type (<code>d</code> for directory, <code>-</code> for a regular file).</li>
        <li>The <strong>2nd-4th characters</strong> represent the user’s permissions (read <code>r</code>, write <code>w</code>, execute <code>x</code>).</li>
        <li>The <strong>5th-7th characters</strong> indicate the group’s permissions.</li>
        <li>The <strong>8th-10th characters</strong> represent permissions for others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changing File Permissions</h2>
    <p>In this task, I must determine whether any files have incorrect permissions and then change 
    the permissions as needed. This action will remove unauthorized access and strengthen 
    security on the system.</p>
    
    <blockquote>&gt;&gt; None of the files should allow the other users to write to files</blockquote>

    <p>To check the current permissions command: <code>ls -l</code></p>
    <p>To remove a write (<code>w</code>) permission for the others (<code>o</code>) I used the change mode command 
    (<code>chmod</code>) :  <code>chmod o-w project_k.txt</code>, where <code>o</code> refers to others (last 3 characters) and <code>-</code> 
    (remove) write permission.</p>

    <h2>Changing File Permissions on a hidden file</h2>
    <p>The file <code>.project_x.txt</code> is a hidden file that has been archived and should not be written to by 
    anyone. (The user and group should still be able to read this file.) To check the hidden permissions I used the 
    <code>ls -la</code> command:</p>

    <p>We can see that the hidden file <strong>.project_x.txt</strong> has write (<code>w</code>) permission for user (1st) and 
    group (2nd) instances. I should remove/change this permission for read only, using the command: 
    <code>chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt</code>.</p>

    <h2>Modifying Directory Permissions</h2>
    <p>I also reviewed the permissions of the <code>/home/researcher2/projects/drafts</code> directory.</p>

    <blockquote>&gt;&gt; Only the <strong>researcher2</strong> user should have access, so I adjusted the permissions to 
    allow only execute (<code>x</code>) privileges for the user.</blockquote>

    <p>I used the command: <code>chmod g-x drafts</code></p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In this lab, I practiced fundamental Linux commands to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examine file and directory permissions,</li>
        <li>Change file permissions, and</li>
        <li>Secure directory permissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These exercises help reinforce key concepts in securing Linux systems by managing access 
    to sensitive resources.</p>
