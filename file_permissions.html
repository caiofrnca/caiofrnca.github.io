    <h1>File Permissions in Linux</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>In this lab, I demonstrated the use of Linux commands to configure file authorization. 
    <Strong>Authorization</Strong> is essential for granting access to specific system resources, ensuring that unauthorized users 
    cannot access or modify sensitive files, which is critical for system security. 
    In Linux, file and directory permissions are used to define who can access particular files and directories.</p>
    
    <p>As a security analyst, setting appropriate access permissions is crucial to protecting sensitive 
    information and maintaining overall system security.</p>

    <h2>Steps to Check File and Directory Details</h2>
    <p>In this scenario, I examined and managed file permissions in the <code>/home/researcher2/projects</code> directory 
    for the user <strong>researcher2</strong>, who is part of the <strong>research_team</strong> group. 
    By using the command <code>ls -la</code>, I verified the permissions for all files in the directory, 
    including hidden files, to ensure they aligned with proper authorization practices.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First, I confirmed the current directory using <code>pwd</code> command then listed all directories with the <code>ls</code> command.</li>
        <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/1Screenshot%202024-10-10%20184058.png" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>
        <li>Next, I accessed the <strong>projects</strong> directory (<code>cd projects</code>) and checked the permissions for all 
        files, including hidden ones, using <code>ls -la</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A dot (<code>.</code>) preceding a file or directory name indicates a hidden item. For instance, in this folder, 
    the file <strong>.project_x.txt</strong> is hidden.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Permissions String</h2>
    <p>Each file or directory entry starts with a <stong>10-character string</stong> that indicates its permissions. 
    For example, the string <code>drwxrwxrwx</code> represents a directory where the owner, group, 
    and others have full permissions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>1st character</strong> <strong>indicates</strong> the file type (<code>d</code> for directory, <code>-</code> for a regular file).</li>
        <li>The <strong>2nd-4th characters</strong> <strong>represent</strong> the user's permissions (read <code>r</code>, write <code>w</code>, execute <code>x</code>).</li>
        <li>The <strong>5th-7th characters</strong> <strong>indicate</strong> the group's permissions.</li>
        <li>The <strong>8th-10th characters</strong> <strong>represent</strong> permissions for others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changing File Permissions</h2>
    <p>In this task, I determined whether any files had incorrect permissions and modified them as necessary. 
    This action removed unauthorized access and enhanced the security of the system.</p>
    
    <blockquote>&gt;&gt; None of the files should allow other users to write to them.</blockquote>

    <p>To check the current permissions, I used the <code>ls -l</code> command.</p>
    <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/2Screenshot 2024-10-10 194156.png" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>
    <p>To remove write (<code>w</code>) permission for "others" (<code>o</code>), I executed the <code>chmod</code> command: 
    <code>chmod o-w project_k.txt</code>, where <code>o</code> refers to others (the last 3 characters in the string), and <code>-</code> 
    removes the write permission.</p>

  </div>

    <h2>Changing File Permissions on a Hidden File</h2>
    <p>The file <code>.project_x.txt</code> is a hidden file that has been archived and should not be written to by 
    anyone. The user and group should still be able to read this file. To check the hidden file's permissions, I ran the 
    <code>ls -la</code> command.</p>
            <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/4Screenshot 2024-10-10 194322.png" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>

    <p>I observed that the hidden file <strong>.project_x.txt</strong> had write (<code>w</code>) permission for the user (1st instance) and 
    the group (2nd instance). To enforce read-only access, I removed the write permissions with the command: 
    <code>chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt</code>.</p>
                <br>

  </div>

    <h2>Modifying Directory Permissions</h2>
    <p>I also reviewed the permissions of the <code>/home/researcher2/projects/drafts</code> directory.</p>

    <blockquote>&gt;&gt; Only the <strong>researcher2</strong> user should have access.</blockquote>
                    <br>

  <img src="./img/6Screenshot 2024-10-10 194431.png" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>

    <p>To ensure this, I adjusted the permissions to allow only execute (<code>x</code>) privileges for the user with the command: 
    <code>chmod g-x drafts</code>.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In this lab, I practiced fundamental Linux commands to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Examine</strong> file and directory permissions,</li>
        <li><strong>Change</strong> file permissions, and</li>
        <li><strong>Secure</strong> directory permissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These exercises reinforced key concepts in securing Linux systems by managing access to sensitive resources.</p>
