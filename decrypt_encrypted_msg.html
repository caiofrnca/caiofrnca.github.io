    <h1>Activity: Decrypt an Encrypted Message</h1>

    <h2>Activity Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this lab, I completed a series of tasks to decrypt an encrypted file, demonstrating the critical role of encryption in securing data in use, at rest, and in transit. Using my Linux skills, I uncovered clues needed to decode a classical cipher, restore a file, and reveal a hidden message, showcasing practical encryption techniques and their importance in safeguarding information.
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Listed the contents of a directory.</li>
        <li>Read and analyzed the contents of files.</li>
        <li>Used Linux commands to decode a classical cipher back to plaintext.</li>
        <li>Decrypted an encrypted file and restored it to its original state.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>
        In this scenario, all files in my home directory were encrypted, requiring me to use Linux commands to break a Caesar cipher and decrypt the files to reveal hidden messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        To complete this task, I first explored the contents of the home directory and read the contents of a file. Next, I discovered a hidden file and successfully decrypted the Caesar cipher within it. Finally, I decrypted the encrypted data file to recover the data and reveal the hidden message.
    </p>

    <h2>Task 1: Read the Contents of a File</h2>
    <p>
        The lab starts in my home directory, <code>/home/analyst</code>, as the current working directory. In this task, I explored the directory contents and read a file to obtain further instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used the <code>ls</code> command to list the files in the current directory. This revealed two files, <code>Q1.encrypted</code> and <code>README.txt</code>, as well as a subdirectory, <code>caesar</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To proceed, I used the <code>cat</code> command to read the contents of the <code>README.txt</code> file:
    </p>
    <p>
        The output provided a crucial message:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Hello, All of your data has been encrypted. To recover your data, you will need to solve a cipher. To get started, look for a hidden file in the caesar subdirectory."
    </blockquote>

                          <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/decrypt_msg/1.png" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>
    
    <p>
        The message advised that the <code>caesar</code> subdirectory contains a hidden file, guiding the next step of the decryption process.
    </p>

    <h2>Task 2: Find a Hidden File</h2>
    <p>
        I needed to locate a hidden file in my home directory and decrypt the Caesar cipher it contained, enabling me to proceed with the next task.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I navigated to the <code>caesar</code> subdirectory using the <code>cd</code> command. Then, I used the <code>ls -a</code> command to list all files, including hidden ones, and found the hidden file <code>.leftShift3</code>.
    </p>

                          <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/decrypt_msg/2.png" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>
    
    <p>
        Hidden files in Linux are identified by names starting with a period (.). To decrypt the hidden file, I read its contents using the <code>cat</code> command. The message appeared scrambled, as it was encrypted using a Caesar cipher, with each letter shifted three positions to the left. To decrypt it, I used the <code>tr</code> command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"</code></pre>
    <p>

                          <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/decrypt_msg/3.png" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>
        
        The <code>tr</code> command translated each letter back to its original position, allowing me to decrypt the cipher and continue to the next step. I returned to the home directory to prepare for the next task.
    </p>

    <h2>Task 3: Decrypt a File</h2>
    <p>
        After solving the Caesar cipher, I used the command revealed in the <code>.leftShift3</code> file to decrypt the <code>Q1.encrypted</code> file and recover the hidden message. I executed the following command to decrypt the file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute</code></pre>
    
                              <div style="text-align: center;">  
  <img src="./img/decrypt_msg/4.png" alt="Listing directories with pwd command" width="600">
  </div>
    
    <p>
        This command used <code>openssl</code> to reverse the encryption with the AES-256-CBC cipher. The <code>-pbkdf2</code> option added security to the key, <code>-a</code> specified the output encoding, and <code>-d</code> indicated decryption. The <code>-in</code> and <code>-out</code> flags were used to specify the input and output files, while <code>-k</code> indicated the password, which in this case was <code>ettubrute</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        After decrypting the file, I used the <code>ls</code> command to list the contents of the directory. The newly decrypted file, <code>Q1.recovered</code>, was displayed. The output revealed:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "If you are able to read this, then you have successfully decrypted the classic cipher text. You recovered the encryption key that was used to encrypt this file. Great work!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I successfully decrypted the <code>Q1.encrypted</code> file, recovered the data, and read the hidden message.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In this lab, I gained practical experience using Linux Bash commands to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>List hidden files,</li>
        <li>Decrypt a Caesar cipher, and</li>
        <li>Decrypt an encrypted file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This lab provided hands-on knowledge in understanding encryption and decryption techniquesâ€”an essential skill for security tasks.
